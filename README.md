# 📘 Java Practice Repository

This repository contains my Java practice assignments.  
Each assignment (`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, …) has its own folder with subfolders for each question (`q1`, `q2`, …).

aX/
├── q1/
├── q2/
├── q3/
├── q4/
├── q5/
├── q6/
├── q7/
└── q8/

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Go to the assignment folder (e.g., `a1`).
2. Open the question folder (e.g., `q3`).
3. Compile the program:
   bash
   javac filename.java


4. Run it:

   bash
   java classname

✍️ This repo will grow as I solve more Java practice questions.
